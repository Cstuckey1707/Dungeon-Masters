List of Character Races:



* Dwarf - "Dwarves are the backbone of mountain strongholds. Renowned for their blacksmithing, ale-brewing, and battle grit, they favor axes, hammers, and grudges that last centuries."



* Elf - "Elves dwell in moonlit forests and crystal towers. Masters of archery and arcane arts, they move with silent grace and speak in riddles older than kingdoms."



* Human -  "Humans are the wild card of the realm. From peasant to paladin, their ambition builds empires, topples tyrants, and writes legends in blood and ink."



* Orc - "Orcs hail from war-scarred plains and bone-laced camps. Their brute strength is matched by fierce loyalty, and their war chants echo across battlefield and canyon."



* Dragonborn - "Dragonborn stride through the world with regal bearing and elemental fury. Their breath can scorch armies, and their honor binds them to ancient oaths."
